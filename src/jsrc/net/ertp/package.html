<p>The <b><i>E</i></b>lectronic <b><i>R</i></b>ights <b><i>T</i></b>ransfer <b><i>P</i></b>rotocol
  provides for oblivious 3rd party assayability for many kinds electronics rights
  transfer.</p>
<p>Capabilities are electronic rights of a sort, but by themselves lack 2 crucial
  features needed for tradable electronic rights: </p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Exclusive rights transfer.
  <li>Assayability (so a 3rd party can determine if a trade is mutually acceptable).
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>ERTP, the next layer above distributed capabilities, does provide these properties.
  The ERTP protocol accommodates fungible &amp; non-fungible rights, exclusive
  &amp; non-exclusive rights, and blinded or non-blinded transfer. Only electronic
  rights manipulable via ERTP are called <i>erights</i>.</p>
<p>ERTP is a simple protocol involving only 4 types and 9 methods. <a href="http://www.erights.org/smart-contracts/erights-updoc.txt">erights.updoc</a>
  shows money re-implemented as a proper eright. Money is <i>exclusive</i>, <i>fungible</i>,
  and <i>non-exercisable</i>. Money transfers should be blinded, but this implementation
  provides only non-blinded transfer.</p>
<p>By contrast, <a href="http://www.erights.org/smart-contracts/exclusive-updoc.txt">exclusive.updoc</a>
  implements, as an exclusively transferable eright, the ability to invoke (pass
  messages to) particular underlying objects that an Issuer decides to make accessible
  in this manner. These erights are <i>exclusive</i>, <i>non-fungible</i>, and
  <i>exersizable</i>. As Nick explains in <i><a href="http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/bearer_contracts.html">Contracts
  with Bearer</a></i>, since these erights are non-fungible, nothing would be
  gained by blinding their transfer.</p>

<p>ERTP has been independently and compatibly implemented as part of the <a href="http://www.waterken.com/Sea/1.0/doc/index.html">Waterken
  Sea</a> package, which also defines many particular erights.</p>
