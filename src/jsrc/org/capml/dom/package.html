<p>This package is a minimal subset of the standard org.w3c.dom, supporting
    only
    immutable downward-pointing-only DOM trees for <a
  href="http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/">Minimal-XML</a>,
    as well as a Minimal-XML quasi-parser for manipulating these trees.</p>

<p>This is a substantial revision by ERights.org of the files <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/java-language-binding.html">as
    released by the w3c</a>, as is allowed by the license. The primary purpose
    of
    the revision is to remove all but a tastefully minimal subset of the
    methods,
    leaving only an immutable tree providing only for downward navigation, and
    therefore
    subtree sharing, and to provide only that subset needed to support the
    Minimal-XML
    subset of XML. In addition, we've added support for E's collections,
    iterators,
    and visitors.</p>

<p>The *Quasi* classes provide a full set of <a
  href="http://www.erights.org/elang/grammar/quasi-xml.html">quasi-literals</a>
    for manipulating these DOM trees.</p>
