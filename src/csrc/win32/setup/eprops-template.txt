# When E wrappers are launched from the desktop, where should their
# current directory be?  Under Linux currently, this option does
# nothing. On Windows, this option records the install-time decision,
# but changing this option doesn't change the decision. Instead, you
# need to modify the shortcuts.

${e.launch.dir}


# Where does trace data go?  This directory will accumulate
# debugging information provided by running E programs in order to
# facilitate a post-mortem analysis of problems. The trace system
# treats the directory as a large circular buffer giving a finite
# window into the past in exchange for a finite memory burden.
